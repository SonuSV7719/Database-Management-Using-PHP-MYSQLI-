<!-- The LIMIT clause makes it easy to code multi page results or pagination with SQL, and is very useful on large tables. Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.

Assume we wish to select all records from 1 - 30 (inclusive) from a table called "Orders". The SQL query would then look like this:

$sql = "SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 30"; -->
